I'm **Lior**, an **independent Full-Stack Developer** and founder of **PrimeDev**.

I help startups, founders, and small teams turn ideas into **working, deployed systems** — not just code, but solutions that are designed to operate in real-world environments.

My background in **Security Operations & Automation (SOC / SOAR)** shapes how I build software:  
I think in **failure scenarios**, **monitoring**, and **operational clarity** from day one.

## 🧠 How I Think About Software
- Start from real-world usage, not just features
